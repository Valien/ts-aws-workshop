# Login to Tailscale

Now that we have our tailnet all created let's dive right in!

## Login to the Tailscale Web UI

If you haven't already logged into Tailscale then do so now by clicking the login link on the Tailscale main page.

That's it! Welcome to the Tailscale web admin page! 

If this is your first time signing in and creating your tailnet you might see a page that looks like this:

![Welcome to Tailscale](/img/welcome_tailscale.png)

For our lab today, you can select **Personal** but if you are interested in completing a full trial you can select **Business**.

## Add your 1st device

When click **Next** you'll see a screen that looks like the following:

![Add 1st device](/img/tailscale_add_device.png)

Follow the instructions to install the Tailscale app on your device. When you have authenticated that device and signed into Tailscale it will show up on the right hand side of the screen.

Alternatively you can also **Skip this introduction** if you are familiar with the interface already and just want to get to the Admin panel.

You should see screens that look similar to this when you have added your device to the tailnet.

Verification if you want to add this device:

Upon successful authentication:

And the status page refreshes showing your device! Cool!

Go ahead and click the  **Skip this introduction** link now instread of adding your second device. We'll do that later on in the workshop.

## Login to the AWS console

Go ahead and open a new browser tab or window and login to your AWS account as well. We will be navigating to the AWS console to view our devices as they come up in your tailnet.

Let's move on to taking a Tour of Tailscale!
