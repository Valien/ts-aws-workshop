# Tour of Tailscale

## The Tailscale Web UI

The Tailscale web UI comprises of the following sections **Machines**, **Apps**, **Services**, **Users**, **Access Controls**, **Logs**, **DNS**, and **Settings**. Let's take a look through each section.


:::note

Tailscale has some built-in roles that can be assigned to different users. Depending on a users role some of these sections may or may  not be viewable for them.

See more about [Roles](https://tailscale.com/kb/1138/user-roles).

### Machines

The [Machines](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines) sections lists all devices that are on your tailnet today. You can filter, view details of each device, 
and more from this page.

### Apps

The [Apps](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/apps) section shows any applications you have connected to your tailnet using the [App connector](https://tailscale.com/kb/1281/app-connectors).

### Services

The [Services](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/services) section (when enabled) shows live services running on your network's machines.  Learn more about [Services](https://tailscale.com/kb/1100/services).

### Users

The [Users](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/users) section shows current tailscale users and their corresponding roles in the tailnet. See more about [Roles](https://tailscale.com/kb/1138/user-roles).

### Access Controls

The [Access controls](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/acls/file) is where you configure, build, and test ACLs for your tailnet. We'll dive more into ACLs later on but you can read more about ACLs in our [docs](https://tailscale.com/kb/1018/acls).

### Logs

The [Logs](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/logs) is where you can view and access both Configuration logs, and Network Flow logs (if you have it on your plan). More docs on [Logs](https://tailscale.com/kb/1349/log-events).

### DNS

This is where all things [DNS](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns) lives including Tailscale's MagicDNS feature. Learn more about [DNS](https://tailscale.com/kb/1054/dns).


### Settings

The [Settings](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/general) page is where you can access personal settings, tailnet settings, and more. Depending on your role you may or may not see all the features available.

## The Tailscale App UI

The Tailscale app, which runs on Apple, Android, Windows, etc looks like this: ![macos app](/img/macapp.png) (The icon, not the color background).

If you click the app it will open up and look similar to what you see here:

Ok! Enough touring! Let's spin up a VM and get to playing with Tailscale!
