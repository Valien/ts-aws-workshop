#  ACLs!

The power of Tailscale is handled through it's robust policy engine and powered by fully customisable ACLs (Access Control Lists).  Let's dig into the ACL section and 
take a look at the current ACLs that your tailnet has by default.

If you haven't already, go ahead and click the **Access controls** tab and you should be seeing page that looks like the following:

![VM Details](/img/tailscale-acls-1.png)

Tailscale is `deny` by default so only traffic that is permitted is allowed to traverse the network. The default ACLs are pretty permissive because it would be bad for you to be locked out when you 
first launch Tailscale. But as you build out your network you will want to start to add more ACLs to segment and break up your network.

Let's take a look at some of the details here.

This workshop is just scratching the surface of what you can do with ACLs. See the links at the bottom of this page for more ACL examples.

### Groups

Groups are way to create groups of users that you can then use to assign ACLs versus assigning ACLs to each user indivdually.

```json
	// Declare static groups of users. Use autogroups for all users or users with a specific role.
	 "groups": {
	  	"group:example": ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.com"],
	 },
```

### Tags
```json
	// Define the tags which can be applied to devices and by which users.
	 "tagOwners": {
	  	"tag:example": ["autogroup:admin"],
	 },
```

### ACLs

```json
	// Define access control lists for users, groups, autogroups, tags,
	// Tailscale IP addresses, and subnet ranges.
	"acls": [
		// Allow all connections.
		// Comment this section out if you want to define specific restrictions.
		{"action": "accept", "src": ["*"], "dst": ["*:*"]},

		// Allow users in "group:example" to access "tag:example", but only from
		// devices that are running macOS and have enabled Tailscale client auto-updating.
		// {"action": "accept", "src": ["group:example"], "dst": ["tag:example:*"], "srcPosture":["posture:autoUpdateMac"]},
	],
```
### SSH

```json
// Define users and devices that can use Tailscale SSH.
	"ssh": [
		// Allow all users to SSH into their own devices in check mode.
		// Comment this section out if you want to define specific restrictions.
		{
			"action": "check",
			"src":    ["autogroup:member"],
			"dst":    ["autogroup:self"],
			"users":  ["autogroup:nonroot", "root"],
		},
	],

```

### Tests

```json
	// Test access rules every time they're saved.
	 "tests": [
	  	{
	  		"src": "alice@example.com",
	  		"accept": ["tag:example"],
	  		"deny": ["100.101.102.103:443"],
	  	},
	 ],
```
